Data Exploration: 

- there are 1494 images of the three categories in training data.
- there are 166 images of three categories in testing data.
- All the images are RGB except masks which contains segments of images that are forged.
- Multiple dimensions are present but many images are having the dimensions (256,384) and (384,256).
!! planning to convert (384,256) to (256,384) to increase images in that dimensions and have to think about other dimensional images.
